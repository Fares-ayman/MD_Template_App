Ex: com/oldname/app/MainActivity  â‡’ com/newname/app/MainActivity and delete old path and old MainActivity and modily in all files to use new MainActivity in new path
6. Update the PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER in ios/Runner/Info.plist and other iOS project files
7. Ensure the project name follows Dart package naming conventions (lowercase, underscores)
8. Ensure the application ID follows reverse domain name notation (e.g., com.company.appname)
9. If Firebase integration is requested, run the uncomment_fire_base rule to enable Firebase features

If Firebase is enabled, it will uncomment Firebase-related code and create empty configuration files
delete old folders and old MainActivity
don`t forget modify the PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER in all ios folders
