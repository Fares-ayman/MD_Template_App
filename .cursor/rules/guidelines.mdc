please do this promps for modified staged changes files in source control and the files doesn't match these steps, please add todo comment explain what the developer should do here 

- Listing the currently staged/modified files in your source control using this command "git diff --name-only --cached"
- and when get files applay this steps on it.

Steps: 

1. Code Readability
Code should be clean, well-formatted, and easy to understand.

Follow naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.

Use meaningful commit messages describing changes clearly.

2. Performance
Check for potential performance issues such as unnecessary builds, inefficient loops, and memory leaks.
please seperate it into new file 

dont use any widget class (class WidgetName extends StatelessWidget {}) in same file with widget class 
dont use any widgets function that return widget like this (Widget functionName() {})
Ensure controllers are properly disposed when not needed (use Get.delete() where necessary).

3. Separation of Concerns (GetX-Specific)
UI should not contain business logic; only handle rendering and user interactions.

Controllers should handle state management using Rx variables and Obx.

Widgets should be stateless unless necessary.

4. Dependency Injection (DI) Best Practices
Use Get.put(), Get.lazyPut(), or Get.find() for dependency management.

Ensure that controllers are properly managed and disposed when no longer in use.

5. Routing Best Practices
Use Get.to(), Get.off(), Get.offAll() for navigation instead of Navigator.push().

Avoid hardcoded route names; use named routes defined in the route file.

6. Clean Code Aspects
Proper naming conventions for namespaces and package names.

Ensure .gitignore is configured correctly to prevent unnecessary files from merging.

Refactor repeated logic into utils/ for better maintainability.

Divide large widgets into smaller reusable components.

Store shared widgets inside globalwidgets/ directory.

Meaningful class and variable names should be used.

Avoid pushing print statements or commented-out code unless documented.

Use enums instead of hardcoded texts to ensure consistency and avoid magic strings.

Ensure proper exception handling to gracefully handle errors and prevent crashes.

7. Documentation
New features or changes must be properly documented.

8. Testing
if the file don`t have any reference test file write a todo comment 
Code should be covered by unit tests and widget tests.

9. Dirty text
don`t use text or dirty text in only Text Widget (Text("")) should but it in locals

10. screen Utils
dont use any hight without .h 
dont use any width without .w 
dont use any fintsize or icon size without .sp 
dont use any radius without .r 

11. color
dont use any color not found in AppColor file 


** Very Important Note
dont do and change , add the todo comments only
